# Choose_skin
Well, thats just a small script on JavaScript, using HTML and CSS, helping PC players(actually CS:GO players) to make their gameplay more interesting.
With this code you can open main HTML file and choose a weapon, which you will use in next game round or in whole game etc.

Hope, this script would be useful for someone. If it really is, im really glad you used it!
